# Quick Start

## Dependencies

### Composer
Install `composer` from its [official download page](https://getcomposer.org/download/), and [make it globally 
executable](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).

### Git
Install `git` from your package manager and ensure it is globally executable.

## Installation

```bash
composer global require davidpeach/composer-manuscript:^5.0
```

## Setup your first manuscript root

```bash
cd /your/chosen/manuscript/root

manuscript init
```

You are now ready to use manuscript to help with building php composer packages. Head to the [commands glossary](./commands.md).
